    "`caustic` is a code for probabilistic modeling of single lens gravitational microlensing events. \n",
    "It is designed primarily to serve as a testbed for new approaches to modeling microlensing events rather than something that can be used in existing pipelines. \n",
    "`caustic` is built on top of the probabilistic programming language `PyMC3` which is used in many fields for the purporse of building and testing Bayesian models. \n",
    "The main feature of PyMC3 is that it enables the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) via the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). \n",
    "HMC enables efficient sampling of high dimensional probabilistic models by utilizing the gradients of the log probability with respect the model parameters. \n",
    "These gradients are obtained through [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation), a method widely used in machine learning to obtain *exact* gradientss of computer code by repeatedly apply the chain rule from calculus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differention (AD) is different from symbolic differentiation (like for example in Wolfram Mathematica) and the finite difference method used in numerical solvers for differential equations.\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is not trivial to do so one usually relies existing libraries which implement it. \n",
    "`PyMC3` uses `Theano` under the hood. You can think of Theano as a sort of compiler that takes code written in Python, compiles it to `C`, builds a graph of all mathematical computations in the code  and propagates the gradients through every node in the graph using reverse mode automatic differentiation ([backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)). \n",
    "`Theano` is best known today as a predecessor to ultra popular machine learning libraries `Tensorflow` and `PyTorch` whose\n",
    "main purpose is also automatic differentiation. \n",
    "Because of the requirement that all models written in `PyMC3` have to be compliant with `Theano`, building physical models\n",
    "is somewhat more complicated than if we were to use `numpy`, although the API is very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the [PyMC3 docs](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/api_quickstart.html) for an introduction to `PyMC3` and probabilistic programming, [docs on Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/introduction.html) for an overview of Theano, and the very recent [exoplanet](https://exoplanet.dfm.io/en/latest/) code for building  differentiable astrophysical models on top of `PyMC3` in the context of explanet transits and radial velocity measurements. `caustic` is very similar to `exoplanet` and uses it as a dependancy. \n",

Unfortunately, the sampling is many orders of magnitude slower because of all additional matrix operations we need to do. There are tricks we can use to speed it up if the covariance matrix of the data is diagonal, but I recommend just sampling in the full space instead. HMC can handle it."
