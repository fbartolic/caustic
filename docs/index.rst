*caustic* is a code designed for Bayesian modeling of single-lens gravitational microlensing 
events using 
`Hamiltonian Monte Carlo<http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/12/19/markov_chain_monte_carlo.html`_. It is built on top of 
`PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io/>`_, `exoplanet<https://exoplanet.dfm.io/en/latest/>`_, and 
`Astropy<http://www.astropy.org/`_.

Although there are now several open-source codes for modeling microlensing events, none 
of those use gradient-based samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. *caustic* is still 
in early development. I hope to release a packaged version before autumn 2019.
